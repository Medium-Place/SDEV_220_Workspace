For the beginning test, as we were just testing basic sums, it first had us put in for one test case where the answer would be correct. Next, we were to add another test case on where the answer would be incorrect. This was to show us the format in which we would receive output based on how our test cases passed or failed the tests. \n",

It also went over how to better understand the output it gives the user so you can better understand the information that is shown. "
